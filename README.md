Hi dear visitor of the Internet! I'm Clément! I am Software Engineer currently working as a Chief Technology Office at [Komia](https://komia.io) in Lyon, France. Lyon is my hometown, I was born and raised here. Working in IT was obvious for me, after years spent in front of the screen instead of going outside play football (or whatever kids are supposed to do).

My career started as a Frontend Software Engineer in a service company called LinkValue in 2018: surrounded by talented people and with a variety of missions, I had opportunities to grow and succeed.

Thoughout the many missions I was given, at Bedrock Streaming, Euronews, Hivebrite or Sparted, I gradually became a leading engineer dedicated to make startups thrive.
